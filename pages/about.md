My name is Austin Schwartz, and I'm currently a Software Engineer at <b><a href="https://www.snap.com">Snap Inc</a></b>. I studied Computer Science at <b>Purdue University</b>, graduating with a BS and MS in 2017. I've previously interned at <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Enova</b>, and <b>Interactive Intelligence</b>, working on various projects in machine learning, backend, web, mobile, etc.</a>

If you're at all interested, I occasionally post on some websites. I cook a lot, and post whatever looks decent to my <b><a href="http://www.instagram.com/austischwartz">Instagram</a></b>. I retweet what mostly ends up being cat pictures on my <b><a href="https://twitter.com/austischwartz">Twitter</a></b>. I keep a logging of whatever books I read or want to keep track of on my <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/austinschwartz">Goodreads</a></b>. I track the music I listen to on <b><a href="http://www.last.fm/user/nonis3">last.fm</a></b>. You can also find my code on <b><a href="http://www.github.com/austinschwartz">Github</a></b> and although I haven't really used it, I'm also on <b><a href="http://www.keybase.io/nonis">Keybase</a></b>. Some more information about me is available on my <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinschwartz/">LinkedIn</a></b>.


I also keep track of whatever books I'm currently reading + the past few books I've read on this website, at the <b><a href="http://austinschwartz.com/books/">books section</a></b>, and of course, the <b><a href="http://austinschwartz.com/posts/">writing section</a></b> will have whatever posts I've made in the past.
