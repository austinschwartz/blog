title: Writing More
---
  In the past, I've had an implicit policy of deleting anything I've done that I haven't felt is up to par with my current work. As I've improved in a skill, I've removed all traces of my training stage. I realized that this then prevented me from seeing how I've progressed, but I felt like looking at my work from the perspective of someone who sees it for the first time, I want to be viewed as someone who gets it right the first time. Someone who doesn't fail, a prodigy even. I feel overwhelmed when viewing the work of certain people.

I feel like I have this mentality of feeling inferior to others, co-workers, other students, and especially when reading tech blogs. I realize that it may be the Dunning-Kruger effect, but recognizing the cognitive bias doesn't make it feel any less real. 

What I need to do is leave my past work up. Show it off, be proud of my work, even if it isn't up to par with my current work. This shows my journey. There's a painter on a website called ConceptArt who started posting paintings and drawings he had done, with no previous experience. He posted simple drawings of shapes and basic objects, then worked his way up, and 10 years later was posting beautiful paintings. You can see his work [here](http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php/870-Journey-of-an-Absolute-Rookie-Paintings-and-Sketches).

The point of this is, I want this blog to be a way for me to improve my craft. I want to get better at writing, blogging, coding, etc. I also eventually want to start drawing more and posting those here. I'll get to that in time.

For now, I've set myself up on a website called Beeminder. Whenever I make a blog post, I log it to a website called Draft, which then sends the word count to Beeminder. Beeminder logs my word counts for each day, and makes sure that I'm writing above what I've set for my expected word count per day. I'm going to try to hit 200 words per day, although that might be an overestimate of my abilities. However, I'm going to try my best!
