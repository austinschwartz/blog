*Exercise 1.1*: Below is a sequence of expressions. What is the result printed by the interpreter in response to each expression?

``` scheme
10                       ; 10
(+ 5 3 4)                ; 12
(- 9 1)                  ; 8
(/ 6 2)                  ; 3
(+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))      ; 6
(define a 3)             ; nothing printed, but a = 3
(define b (+ a 1))       ; nothing printed, but b = 4
(+ a b (* a b))          ; 19
(= a b)                  ; #f
(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
  b
  a)                     ; 4
(cond ((= a 4) 6)
      ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
      (else 25))         ; 16
(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))   ; 6
(* (cond ((> a b) a)
         ((< a b) b)
         (else -1))
   (+ a 1))              ; 16
```


*Exercise 1.2*: Translate the following expression into prefix form: 
$$\frac{5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + \frac{4}{5})))}{3(6 - 2)(2 - 7)}$$

``` scheme
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))

;or indented
(/ 
  (+ 5 4 
     (- 2 
        (- 3 
           (+ 6 
              (/ 4 5))))) 
  (* 3 
     (- 6 2) 
     (- 2 7)))
```


*Exercise 1.3*: Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

``` scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (large-sum-of-squares a b c)
  (- (+ (square a)
        (square b)
        (square c))
     (square (min a b c))))
```

*Exercise 1.4*: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

``` scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

This procedure uses an if statement to determine if b is to be added or subtracted to a, depending on whether or not b is negative. It returns a + the absolute value of b.

*Exercise 1.5*: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpret her is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:
``` scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
    0
    y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

``` scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

If we use applicative-order evaluation, which our interpreter uses, we get to the test call, and we evaluate all the arguments (0 and p). When it comes time to evaluate p, it is evaluated as a recursive call to itself, which will never stop recursing.

In normal-order evaluation, we evaluate the arguments only when the values are needed. When `(test 0 (p))` gets expanded, it ends up being something like

``` scheme
(if (= 0 0)
  0
  p))
```

which just returns 0, and p never needs to be evaluated any further.
