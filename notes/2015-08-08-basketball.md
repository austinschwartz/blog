This is an interesting problem from CtCI v6.

You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.

Game 1: You get one shot to make the hopp.

Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.

Solution
---------

**Probability of winning game 1**

$P[\textrm{Game 1}] = p$ by definition
