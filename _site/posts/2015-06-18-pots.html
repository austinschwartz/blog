          <p>I somehow stumbled upon this article by <a href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a> titled <a href="https://sivers.org/qlq">“Does quantity + learning = quality?”</a> He references a parable from the book <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000216.php">Art and Fear</a>, which follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ceramics teacher announced he was dividing his class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right graded solely on its quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would weigh the work of the “quantity” group: 50 pounds of pots rated an A, 40 pounds a B, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an A.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, come grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m somewhat realizing that many things I’ve tried to get into (art, web dev, piano, blogging), I did just what the quality group was doing. Instead of drawing, writing, whatever, actually sitting down and creating something, I instead relegated myself to learning about the topic and keeping my distance. When I did sit down and make something, I would be embarassed of its poor quality. For example, I’ve always wanted to know how to draw. However, every time I sit down and try to draw, I quickly get discouraged. I realize that I need to just put the pencil to paper and not worry about the quality as long as I’m improving.</p>
<p>I think my takeaway is that I need to start actually producing things. Even if I do substandard work, as long as I’m improving, then I should get where I want to be.</p>
